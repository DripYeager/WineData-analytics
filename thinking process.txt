first i removed rows user_name, review title, review description, points

then i tried to find the na values and filled price value by averaging the price of that variety of wine
also out of 103322 rows almost half of them 58459 had no value for region2 so i removed it

also there were 30309 types of designations and 29636 were empty thats combined that is 59945 which is more than half of the dataset so i dropped that too.

there are too many types of regions for one variety of wine (378 for 11753(Chardonnay) which is 29 per region) this will decrease models accuracy. so i am dropping this factor too.

after doing all this there were 39 total rows empty because of country and province so we dropped them because it is very small compared to size of dataset.

we started with 103322 rows and now we have 103283 rows of sorted data which is only 39 less.

now there are many provinces with very few counts(even many are with count 1 only). also there are 278 province with count less than 50 and 299 with province less than 100 and 91 greater than 50. so i will mark all these provinces as others
so now including others i have 92 types of provinces

similarly for winery there are 12151 winery less than 10 so marking them as other
now there are 92 unique winery
